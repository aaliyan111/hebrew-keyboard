a half-baked "virtual" keyboard for Hebrew.
See it in action: x302.net/wthw/hebrew-keyboard

TODO:
 - add space key
 - replace Holam after Vav with Holam Haser for Vav - defer until save/search
 - on input force canonic order for accent mark, vowel sign and dagesh
 - workaround Iconbit tablet bug - missing "Erase Right" &#x2326; glyph
