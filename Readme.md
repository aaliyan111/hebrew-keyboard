a half-baked "virtual" keyboard for Hebrew (think Lambdin!).

JS skeleton modeled after [PƒÅli keyboard](https://siongui.github.io/2017/01/28/javascript-virtual-keypad/) as published by [@siongui](https://github.com/siongui)

TODO:
 - add space key
 - replace Holam after Vav with Holam Haser for Vav - defer until save/search
 - on input force canonic order for accent mark, vowel sign and dagesh
 - workaround Iconbit tablet bug - missing "Erase Right" &#x2326; glyph
